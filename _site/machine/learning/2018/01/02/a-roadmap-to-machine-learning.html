        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">A Roadmap to Machine Learning</h1> -->

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Up until a point in my life, I was learning stuff left and right aimlessly, and leaving the knowledge at an unfinished, quite frankly unusable level.
I changed that when I started learning web development. I found enough resources to create a plan, a roadmap of stuff I’d have to learn in order to become a real Web Developer.
That roadmap changed quite a bit according to new technologies I discovered, but ultimately worked wonders for me.</p>

<p>In November 2017, after speaking with a lot of people in academia about it, I decided that machine learning and especially deep learning looks fascinating to me. So much so, that I decided to start learning it, alongside my ever-evolving web development skills (as of writing this, I have experience with front end and slowly moving towards full stack).</p>

<p>I looked around and, to my surprise, even though there is a crazy amount of courses and resources available for machine learning, I found not a single clear path on how to tackle it.</p>

<p>So I did some research, and here I present you the roadmap I came up with. It is focused in Python as the programming language, since it has great coverage of machine learning packages and it’s extremely easy to learn. I only include free Udacity course material - I am not affiliated with them in any way, I’ve just found the classes I’ve taken so far to be really well thought of, well structured, and with a lot of hands-on work.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap-to-machine-learning">Roadmap to Machine Learning</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-environment">Step 1: Environment</h3>

<p>The first thing is to set up our environment so we can actually run the algorithms and programs on our computer. Strictly speaking, we only need Python (and that’s what I’ve been using until now) but having specialized tools sometimes makes us more productive. I decided to set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install Python/pip
  Python and it’s package manager, pip, are really all we need. The first course uses Python 2.7, but we will probably be better off installing Python 3.x as well later on.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use IPython</li>
  <li>Learn how Jupyter Notebooks work</li>
  <li>Install Anaconda and learn how to use it
  Anaconda and it’s package manager, conda, is a distribution of Python specialized for machine learning and data science.</li>
  <li>Learn how a good dataset is structured
  Less of an environment thing, but I’ll leave it here because it should be one of the first things you do.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-2-classrom---basics">Step 2: Classrom - Basics</h3>

<p>In this step, we’ll focus on learning the basics of machine learning. We need to learn what it is, where it’s used, what different types of machine learning exist, and get familiar with some of the major algorithms and working with data.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120">Intro to Machine Learning (Udacity course)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1787125939">Python Machine Learning (Book)</a>
  This book is not free, however I see it strongly recommended and having bought it, I can say it’s a great practical book and I’ve found that reading a book cover-to-cover on a particular subject gives you in-depth knowledge of aforementioned subject. You’ll also always have it laying around for quick reference.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3-get-your-feet-wet-project-1">Step 3: Get Your Feet Wet (Project #1)</h3>

<p>This will be different for everyone. I recommend going to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> and using one of their datasets for something you want to figure out, using machine learning. Personally, I have a plan for a project that I will reveal in due time.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-classroom---going-deeper">Step 4: Classroom - Going Deeper</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve used machine learning in an actual, real world dataset, without any guidance, we’re ready to get a deeper understanding of data and the math behind machine learning.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359">Intro to Data Science (Udacity course)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827">Intro to Descriptive Statistics (Udacity course)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201">Intro to Inferential Statistics (Udacity course)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf">Elements of Statistical Learning (Free ebook)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-5-build-a-portfolio">Step 5: Build a Portfolio</h3>

<p>We now have a really good understanding of machine learning, but if we don’t practice it, it will only be theoretical. This step is probably the most important part. We have to go ahead and work on Kaggle datasets, join competitions, hopefully find a dataset that’s specifically interesting to us and something we want to learn about - this is actually where we can shine!</p>

<h3 id="step-6-one-step-further">Step 6: One Step Further</h3>

<p>We can stop there, or we can move on to the very specialized area of machine learning that is slowly taking the world by storm, deep learning. This will have to be a roadmap in itself, but for now, I’ll add this one link - the first part is about going from machine learning to deep learning.</p>

</ul>

<p>So there you have it. I wish you the best in this journey, and happy new year!</p>
