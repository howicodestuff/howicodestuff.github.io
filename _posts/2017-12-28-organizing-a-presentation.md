# Organizing a Successful Presentation of a Coding Subject/Project

Oftentimes, we bring to life an interesting idea or an innovative implementation. However, that is only half the work, I would say the fun half. The other half involves trying to coordinate and market that idea so that it makes the maximum impact possible. This, according to me, and most likely you too, is the half you have to grind.

In this article we are only going to touch the subject of presenting that idea in a conference or seminar. For simplicity, I'm going to assume you have a project you want to present. If instead you want to do a seminar on a more abstract subject (MVCs for example, or even how to use a particular MVC) then you can still follow these steps.

## How Can I Successfully Coordinate a Presentation?

It depends. If you are lucky and have a supportive team around you, you should split all of these tasks and divide them between your team and yourself. If not, you'll have to do them yourself - don't worry, we'll break it down into bite-size, manageable tasks.

### Coordination

The presentational work has to be coordinated for maximum efficiency. The coordinator should:

* have the main person of the project write a draft article about the project
* have that draft sent to a blogger/writer for a website/blog post to be written
* have the photographer take applicable photos and videos (around 3x what they think is enough, is enough) or a graphic designer create applicable art
* have a person who will be responsible for posting said project's marketing material on social media (including LinkedIn), and create a plan for them
* have someone put up flyers in applicable University/College sites and student hangout places

And then, if there will be a presentation for the project:

* have the project's main person(s) create the presentation
* pass it through the design expert, and have special logos/charts/art made for it
* arrange a place and a time for it and go through the first steps in order to promote it


### Presentation

Probably the most important part of marketing the project, sometimes more so than the project itself. The presentation should be clear enough to follow along just by reading the slides after the event, but also compact so as the speaker does not just read the slides but gives a presentation based on them - this also helps with the font being bigger so that people can see it better. 

The speaker should:

* write or at least take part in writing the presentation
* have good knowledge of the subject and specific project
* rehearse the first drafts of his presentation in the mirror
* record video of himself/herself doing the full presentation, and check for details such as turning his/her back too much, speaking too softly, going into deep detail on unnecessary parts of the project, going into stuff that does not directly apply to the message he/she is trying to get across etc.
* present it to the team, friends, relatives or anyone who can give back listener feedback
* encourage for questions, and video tape it so he/she can respond better to similar questions
* make a list of likely to be asked questions and write down answers for them

### During the presentation

* introduce yourself first
* talk about motivation for the project
* social media person should add to Instagram and Facebook story throughout the event, and make 1 post about an hour before the beginning of the presentation about it starting soon
* remember to have fun

### Leaving a good last impression

At the end of the presentation, the speaker should:

* encourage questions from the crowd 
* give out contact info so that private questions and inquiries can be asked
* hang around the presentation area and be approachable for one-to-one encounters
* ideally, have business cards ready

### Follow up

After the event, the slides from the presentation as well as any video and photos of it should be added to a press release about the success of the event. This should go to:

* an article or blog post
* social media, including LinkedIn
* schedule a #TBT for a month, six months and a year after the event
