This is my first post. I've decided to introduce myself and present what I'm going to talk about in this blog.

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char name[50];
  char *me = name;
  me = "Christos";
  printf("Hello World! I'm %s.\nWelcome to my blog!\n", me);
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

...C is powerful and I love it, but very complicated if you want to do some simple things.

Anyway.

So, you may have figured this out already, but my name is Christos. I am a student of Computer Science in the University of Ioannina, Greece.
I love building software and learning new things. I'm interested in web application development, machine learning, systems programming, Linux and Open Source Software.

In this blog, I will be documenting my discovery of problems and their solutions, the process of writting code and building stuff, as well as development tools and setting our environment up for that.

I hope to see you again next time!
