Good evening everyone!

After a pretty hard couple of weeks, I finally have some time to myself. I intend to use it in the most constructive way possible. Other than working out, eating well, studying smart (instead of hard), and prioritizing my work correctly in the morning so I can be as productive as possible, I've decided to take the 100DaysOfCode challenge.

# \#100DaysOfCode

[100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) is a challenge similar to others like 100DaysOfHealth, 100DaysOfFitness, etc. Basically, you have to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days, which is a huge commitment, but it makes it easy to stay motivated by being accountable to the whole world. I think it's a great idea! I was introduced to it by [the AI Jedi](http://theaijedi.com/), a stranger who I've been following for a while.

A few months ago I wrote this [Pomodoro website](https://czonios.github.io/pomodoro/) and I intend to complete **at least** 2 pomodori a day for this challenge.

Now, I already know how to code, I code maybe about 5 hours a day already because I work part-time in web application development, and I also have a lot of University projects which frequently require coding. However, the description of this challenge is not that strict - so I'll use that to my advantage.

For the next 100 days, I'll be teaching myself machine learning and especially deep learning. I've already created a [roadmap to machine learning](https://howicodestuff.github.io/machine_learning/2018/01/12/a-roadmap-to-machine-learning.html), and I'm about halfway through, so I'm going to get started on a project as soon as I can, and study more about this area in the meantime.

I invite you all to join me on this journey, and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christoszonios) so you can see my everyday progress, and show me yours. I'll also be giving periodic updates on this blog. Their frequency is not yet decided, but I thought maybe every 15 or 20 days is a good starting point.

See you on the next one, and happy coding!
